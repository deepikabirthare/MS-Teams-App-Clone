    <h2>What I learned during my project?</h2>
<p>In this section I am going to list some of the techinical and non-techinical
information I learned.</p>
<h3>1. Agile Methodology</h3>
<p><strong>What is Agile Methodology</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is an iterative approach that is used to design complicated software.</li>
<li>In this method, project teams are allowed to be more flexible</li>
<li>ensure that the final product is fulfilling the customerâ€™s requirements.</li>
<li>It develops customer-centric products and delivers in shorter sprints.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is how I implemented the Agile Methodology in my project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Designed a structure of the clone interface.</li>
<li>Build a application before the build phase started but it failed.
Build the application again.</li>
<li>Created the BeckEnd part and tested on local host.</li>
<li>Came to know about flaws of using peerjs server, that's why hosted
my own peerjs server</li>
<li>deployed app on heroku server and tested with a friend</li>
<li>Research on why the connection failed and how it can be established</li>
<li>Got a solution: xirsys provides free turn server urls, thanks to xirsys.</li>
<li>included the turn server. Deployed and tested again.</li>
<li>This time it worked but it failed while testing with my mentor when I
she was using her laptop. Came to know about the reason.
<ul>
<li>Here I want to mention some of the fixes if user1 is not
able to get user2 video
<ul>
<li>
<p>Try Connecting using Edge, as sometimes there is security issue with Chrome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try connecting using Phone as <strong>my mentors laptop was provided by Microsoft so was not supporting the app, as she told me it was compatible with MS Teams only</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In all other normal cases the app would work fine.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>2. Why actually turn servers issue occurs and why was peer to peer not working?</h2>
<p>I think writing on this issue might help others as well who will try to deploy their
their application without using services like <strong>Azure or AWS</strong>.</p>
<p>The issue occurs due to following reasons when one tries to connect using webrtc:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stun servers used in connection using webrtc are unable to get other user's video and audio when:</p>
<ul>
<li>firewall comes in between</li>
<li>NAT comes in between</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then turn servers comes to rescue, instead of direct peer to peer connection, turn servers establishes the conncetion by relaying the traffic themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here is the situation described :</p>
<ul>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. How to write documentation using jsdocs?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Documentation and Code Architecture is very important for any Project for other's to understand our project structure and code.</p>
<ul>
<li>I came to know about code architecture from my mentor and included it as well in the tutorial.</li>
<li>Here are some of the things I struggled a lot to figure out, hope they might help others.</li>
<li>We can host our documentation separately using github pages by hosting only the <strong>docs directory.</strong></li>
<li>And we can deploy our application on Heroku along with the docs folder no need to remove it while deploying.</li>
<li>Should not add docs in .gitignore otherwise they won't be hosted on github</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How to include images in documentation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>we can include static files in default template of jsdoc then use img tag to include images.</li>
<li>It's available in the documentation of <strong>better-docs</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Of course I learned a lot of new technologies!</h2>
<ul>
<li>since I had never build a beckend application before I learned:
<ul>
<li>react though I figured out I can build this project without using React</li>
<li>beckend Development using nodejs and express</li>
<li>how requests and response works</li>
<li>how frontend actually interacts with beckend</li>
<li>webrtc, socket.io and peerjs</li>
<li>how turn and stun servers work</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Lastly here are the few non-technical things I learned:</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Just try it!</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I had no plan of working on this project thinking that if I will work on it, then I would lose my time to study for internships coming in July.</li>
<li>But then I realised if I am scared to take up the challenge then I must definitely try it once, I might fail but it's better than losing confidence due to  fear of failure.</li>
<li>Just know why you are doing something.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>There is always a solution</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>When I encountered the turn server issue I spend two days searching for the solution but found nothing, but then one of my friend helped me in finding Xirsys Turn server</li>
<li>And I also discovered about Microsoft Azure and Amazon's AWS free trial services that might have helped me.</li>
<li>But finally the issue was solved.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Design as if you are the consumer of the product</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I designed the UI thinking how I would like to see it if I have to use it for video chat app.</li>
<li>Keeping this in mind help us to design user friendly UI.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>The reason for not being able to incorporate chat feature fully in the app</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>As mentioned in the code architecture the chat feature works when the user is in the call and not after or before the call and it is yet to be implemented</li>
<li>The reason I was not able to complete it was I had my exams from 12th July and I had to prepare.</li>
</ul>
<h2>That's all for this project.</h2>
